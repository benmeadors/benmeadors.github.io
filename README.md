## Welcome to my github page. 

I am a solutions architect, focused on implementing cutting edge technology to make creating content faster and easier. Currently I'm the manager of post-production technology for Spotify Studios. This is my code repository for apps and scripts I've created in Python. I am not a programmer by trade, although I did have ~2 years of computer science classes in college, including C++/C#, Visual Basic, and MYSQL, before focusing on my degree of information systems. I'm most interested in building apps that connect systems to automate media and entertainment workflows.
