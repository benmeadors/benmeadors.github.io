## Welcome to my github page. 

I am a solutions architect, focused on implementing cutting edge technology to make creating content faster and easier. Currently I'm the manager of post-production technology for Spotify Studios. This is my code repository for apps and scripts I've created in Python. I am not a programmer by trade, although I did have ~2 years of computer science classes in college, including C++/C#, Visual Basic, and MYSQL, before focusing on my degree of information systems. I'm most interested in building apps that connect systems to automate media and entertainment workflows. 

### [Event driven applications for Iconik]https://github.com/benmeadors/IconikCloudFunctions
These are event-driven serverless applications I've written in Python to automate business processes inside Iconik.io, a hybrid-cloud asset management system that has a REST API. I run these in Google Cloud as cloud functions. My learning goal this year is to learn Flask and Docker and containerize these. 

### [Iconik API Wrapper]https://github.com/benmeadors/IconikWrapper

This is my on-going project to create an API wrapper in Python for Iconik.io. Iconik is a hybrid-cloud asset management system. I wrote this for myself to save time, and for the rest of my team to reference as they start to learn Python too. This was also a chance for me to explore classes in Python. 

### [Rev.com API Wrapper]https://github.com/benmeadors/RevWrapper

This is another on-going project. I'm working on an integration between Iconik.io and Rev.com, a transcription service. This is an API wrapper for Rev.com's API, to upload a file to Rev's server, create and submit a transcription order for that file, and and get order info after the fact.
